# rpart
This is the source for a cardiac risk predicting Shiny app (based on decision tree package rpart GNU v3) created for use in assignment for Health Informatics Master's curriculum at Karolinska Institutet/Stockholm University in May 2017. 

# application
app.R is an original shiny app that contains both ui object and server functions written in R using common R packages and open source documentation, under GNU v3, for hosting on a shiny server: for instance, shinyapps.io  

It is created for educational purposes during graduate degree program; in current form, is not intended to be actually used for direct patient care, given unproven clincial effectiveness.
